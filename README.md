# hugo-utils

> Tools for managing [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) websites.

`hugo-utils` contains a set of tools that I use to manage my own blog: [https://ops.tips](https://ops.tips).

Although `hugo` by itself makes the production a breeze, when you start having a bunch of content, it might become hard to manage the consistency between how content is tagged and managed as a whole.

This set of auxiliary tools comes handy for those who want to make sure that:

- their content is always up to date (remind you if old blog posts need attention);
- every post is properly tagged; and
- taxonomy terms (like, a specific category) have metadata alright.
